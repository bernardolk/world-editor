 * triangle-ray intersection algorithm depends on triangle orientation. Can i understand why? Should i make it work for whatever orientation? Or is it unnecessary?
 
 * Making it work, it`s time to select objects (create new editor state variable) and enable movement of them through the GUI_controls 
	(if any entity selected, show control window)
 
 * Then, make it possible to move them using the mouse

 * render light placeholders in scene
 
 * make lights selectable as well, and edit their color behaviour
